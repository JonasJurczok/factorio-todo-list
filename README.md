Factorio Todo-List
------------------

A distributed todo list for Factorio to keep track of all the tasks in your factory.

## Why?

We are playing a lot of multiplayer Factorio in our free time.
Especially as bases grow and you progress into the late game it becomes more and more
difficult to keep track of all the little things you are planning and have yet to do.

During every session our desk fills with paper notes with little tasks on them but we
always keep being annoyed by this less than perfect solution. Hence this mod was created :)

## How to use it?

### Basic usage

Upon starting a game with this mod (or loading an existing save for that matter) you will
find a small button in the upper left corner. Just click it or press shift-T :)

### Adding tasks

Click the `Add` button to add a new task.
You can enter a multiline text and choose an assignee. Picking an assignee is optional.

### Assigning tasks

There are two ways to assign a task to someone:

* If a task is created or edited you can pick an assignee there.
* If a task is unassigned you can click the `Assign to me` button to assign it to yourself.

### Completing tasks

Just click the checkbox besides the task to mark it as completed.
The task will be moved to the done list.

To get it back to the open list, just click on the `Show completed tasks` button and uncheck the checkbox.

### Editing tasks

Click on the edit button besides a task to bring up a small screen.
There you can modify the task.

### Deleting tasks
If you want to remove a task you can do that from the edit screen.

### Hide the minimized UI?

Is the minimized UI (the "Todo List" button) still taking up your precious
screen space?

In the settings menu you can disable it. Then you'll only
be able to use the hotkey (default shift-t) to show/hide the todo list.
